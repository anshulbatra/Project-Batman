## Javascript
> Javascript is an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. JavaScript is most commonly used as a client side scripting language. This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do something with it.<br/> <br/>
